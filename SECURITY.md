# Security Policy

We appreciate your dedication to the safety of CardMesh. The security of our extension is our paramount concern, and
community assistance is invaluable.

# Vulnerability Reporting

If you suspect a vulnerability, we encourage you to share it with us by sending an email
to [@MathiasReker](https://github.com/MathiasReker) at
github@reker.dk. Please refrain from publicizing the issue before we have thoroughly investigated and resolved it. Our
commitment is to acknowledge your report promptly and maintain clear communication throughout the process.

Thank you for your contribution in enhancing CardMesh's security!
